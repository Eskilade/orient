	abstract = {A Lie group is an old mathematical abstract object dating back to the {XIX} century, when mathematician Sophus Lie laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups. Its inﬂuence has spread over diverse areas of science and technology many years later. In robotics, we are recently experiencing an important trend in its usage, at least in the ﬁelds of estimation, and particularly in motion estimation for navigation. Yet for a vast majority of roboticians, Lie groups are highly abstract constructions and therefore difﬁcult to understand and to use.},
